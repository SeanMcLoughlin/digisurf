# DigiSurf

A TUI signal waveform viewer.

## To Do

- [ ] Wrap the waveform in a chart and use the chart axes to show a scalable timescale view.
- [ ] Non-binary wave support (e.g. show values in hexadecimal instead of binary high/low)
- [ ] Simple mouse events for clicking signal names to highlight them.
- [ ] Markers
- [ ] Zoom into selection of waves based on mouse selection
- [ ] Fuzzy search for signal names
- [ ] FSDB parsing
- [ ] Wave DB file streaming for performance
- [ ] Vim-like command mode (or at least better keybindings, depends on how complex this tool will get)
- [ ] Color picker for each wave
- [ ] Wave style for each wave
- [ ] Embedded text editor, showing signal values at marker
- [ ] Export signal selections and markers to config file of some sort
- [ ] Export selection to SVG(?)
